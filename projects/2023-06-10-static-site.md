# // Static Sites and Over Engineering

As I was looking at my portfolio website [iBreak.Systems](https://ibreak.systems), I realized I was a little bored with the tech that was running it.  The site used to run on a custom, semi-static, CMS I wrote.  I wrote the semi-static CMS years ago when I still thought I had any interest in frontend engineering of any kind.  That has not been the case for 7 years, unless I'm backendÂ² I'm not happy.

Recently starting my most recent journey into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) I decided that should prepare to write more articles and do more projects.  This forced me to update the articles in my undocumented Angular CMS that is over half a decade old.  After taking a brief look into the editor I realized I really didn't want to do this and I would much I would rather migrate to a proper static site generator.  Bring in [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/).

[Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) is a bare bones static site generator written in Rust.  The templates are managed in [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), a template language created by shopify.  After spending an hour with Cobalt and Lquid I was off the races dusting off my ancient CSS skills, learned about some new-to-me tech like `flexbox` and `has()`, and got to writing.

Needless to say this project post is a long winded Hello World!  If you would like to follow more on this project check out the [repo here](https://github.com/0x4445565A/0x4445565A.github.io).

## Easter Eggs
For those still poking around, your might enjoy the following bits and bobs.

_Minimize and Maximize buttons_: These buttons on the editor expand and contract my about me.  This allows me to keep the element but on other pages keep it collapsed.  It is the most important thing on the site so I need to keep it accessible.

_Projects images_: The skew and rgb scanlines are all done in CSS, I thought it was clever.  Of course the scanline css was lifted from the [CRT Display Article by Alec Lownes](http://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html).

_Close Button_: We don't talk about what the close button on the editor does.
