  <h3>About</h3>: """
<p>Hello, my name is <b>Brandon Martinez</b> and I'm a software engineer.  I do my best work working on high speed high availability systems.  My favorite projects are usually tools I wrote for other engineers.  I have a passion for the lowest level of technology and efficiency, so much so my biggest hobby is manufacturing electronics in my home EE lab.</p>  """,
