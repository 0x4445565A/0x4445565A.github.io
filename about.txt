  <h3>About</h3>: """
<p>Hello, my name is <b>Brandon Martinez</b> and I'm a developer.

I have spent the last decade working with a myriad of technologies.  These have ranged from older languages like Perl all of the way to fancy new MVC/MVW Javascript frameworks like AngularJS and Meteor.I also have extensive experience in both offensive and defensive security for applications and systems.  Currently I have been spending most of my time developing in GoLang, NodeJS, and AngularJS.  I have really fallen in love with these tools.

In the next few years I see myself primarily developing with MVC JS frameworks.  I honestly believe tools like AngularJS are the future of the Internet.</p>  """,
