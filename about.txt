  <h3>About</h3>: """
<p>Hello, my name is <b>Brandon Martinez</b> and I'm a developer.

I have spent the last decade working with a myriad of technologies.  These have ranged from older languages like Perl all of the way to fancy new MVC/MVW Javascript frameworks like AngularJS and Meteor.I also have extensive experience in both offensive and defensive security for applications and systems.  Currently I have been spending most of my time developing in GoLang, NodeJS, and AngularJS.  I have really fallen in love with these tools.

Currently, I see myself primarily developing with Go.  I have an interest in most things Go is capable of, I love the speed and proficiency that it works at.  Most likely with Go I would be a good fit in automation or embedded systems.</p>  """,
