# iBreak.systems Code Repo

I decided to turn my domain iBreak.systems into a portfolio site instead of a blog that no one reads!

It's a simple page that I built in a day using AngularJS and AngularMaterials.

Not much else to add, oh it also has Raptor support, just click on the "close" button on the mock Sublime editor.
