    Starting off I have to say I love <a href="https://keybase.io" target="_blank">KeyBase.io</a> and I think what they are doing is fantastic.  Enabling PGP encryption and decryption and signing for normal people.  I honestly think things like this will take encryption to the public, because as most encryption nerds know.  The more people using encryption the more effective it is.

    There is one short coming Keybase has though, and that is message support.  If I want to have Gam-Gam send me the secret cookie recipe but I don't want a spy to steal it mid email I would want to have her encrypt it.  Now here is the issue.  If I want Gam-Gam to encrypt the cookie recipe I have to tell her to either go through CLI(not going to happen) or to go to the Keybase site, go to my profile, encrypt the recipe, copy the text, open her email program, pastte, and finally send the encrypted message.  That is WAY too many steps for Gam-Gam.

So I decide to create a proof of concept.  Here are the constraints.<ul><li>Can't be dynamic</li><li>Encrypts using my PGP key</li><li>Can be copy and pasted anywhere</li><li>Easy to implement</li><li>Is 100% Free</li></ul>
    Holy crap, you might be thinking, that's a lot of demands and is totally unrealistic.  Well, I would say you're right but I have managed to find a way.  It's very simple too.  It uses Github Pages(Or any static HTML host), FormSpree.io, and of course Keybase.io.  Now you might recognize Github pages and Keybase, but if you're wondering about FormSpree you need to know it is fantastic.  It allows you to send emails through a cross origin post request.  To prevent spam what they have done is that the form recipient needs to verify the "to" email address before any emailing can occur.  Even better is that you can make your own forms and write the HTML how ever you want, so no iframes, only good 'ol POST.
