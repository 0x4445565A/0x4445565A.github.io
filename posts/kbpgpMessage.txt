    Starting off I have to say I love <a href="https://keybase.io" target="_blank">KeyBase.io</a> and I think what they are doing is fantastic.  Enabling PGP encryption and decryption and signing for normal people.  I honestly think things like this will take encryption to the public, because as most encryption nerds know.  The more people using encryption the more effective it is.

<h2>State of Keybase Ease of Use (For Grandma)</h2>
    There is one shortcoming Keybase has though, and that is message support.  If I want to have Gam-Gam send me the secret cookie recipe but I don't want a spy to steal it mid email I would want to have her encrypt it.  Now here is the issue.  If I want Gam-Gam to encrypt the cookie recipe I have to tell her to either go through CLI(not going to happen) or to go to the Keybase site, go to my profile, encrypt the recipe, copy the text, open her email program, pastte, and finally send the encrypted message.  That is WAY too many steps for Gam-Gam.

<h2>Finding a Solution</h2>
So I decide to create a proof of concept.  Here are the constraints.<ul><li>Can't be dynamic</li><li>Encrypts using my PGP key</li><li>Can be copy and pasted anywhere</li><li>Easy to implement</li><li>Is 100% Free</li></ul>
    Holy crap, you might be thinking, that's a lot of demands and is totally unrealistic.  Well, I would say you're right but I have managed to find a way.  It's very simple too.  It uses Github Pages(Or any static HTML host), FormSpree.io, and of course Keybase.io.  Now you might recognize Github pages and Keybase, but if you're wondering about FormSpree you need to know it is fantastic.  It allows you to send emails through a cross origin post request.  To prevent spam what they have done is that the form recipient needs to verify the "to" email address before any emailing can occur.  Even better is that you can make your own forms and write the HTML how ever you want, so no iframes, only good 'ol POST.

<h2>The Result</h2>
<iframe src="./message.html" style="border: none;overflow:hidden;margin:0 auto;width:50%;height:290px;"></iframe>

    Basically what you would end up doing is send your page or where ever this is hosted to Gam-Gam and tell her to type the message and her email ad submit it.  No need to tell her about encryption or the under lying system.  The best part is, it's easy.  It goes to your email, the reply to is going to be Gam-Gam and it just works.  The only issue I see is there is no public CDN to host but honestly if you can host an HTML file you can host one JS file (You can get the KBPGP.js file <a href="https://keybase.io/kbpgp" target="_blank">here</a>).

    There are some security implications here that should be made aware of.  If you aren't hosting the KBPGP.js file on HTTPs it can be modified in a Mitm attack the form could also be modified.  Unfortunately for me Github pages (as of right now) doesn't support HTTPS for custom domains, hopefully it will soon.  IF you use just youruser.github.io you can force HTTPS and it will work and be fantastic.  Another concern is that FormSpring could log the communication, but it is encrypted completely client side (Out side of downloading your private key, which can be hard-coded) so there isn't that big of a deal.  I want to stress this is not for VERY important communications, this is PGP encryption but it leaves so many things to chance due to being in browser that can't be fixed by writing better JS.  Do not leave your life or freedom in the piece of a single piece of software.
<h2>Overview</h2>Copy and paste the code from <a href="https://github.com/0x4445565A/0x4445565A.github.io/blob/master/message.html" target="_blank">here</a> and host it on a static HTML site.  Once you have this you simply send that link to people you want to message you instead of a long list of overly complicated instructions.  This isn't so much as a perfect solution to make Keybase globally 100% use able, instead it's an attempt at making this technology more accessible.

Stay safe and encrypt <b>everything</b>!
