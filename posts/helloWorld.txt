    I wanted a quick way to jot down ideas and code that I didn't see fit as a project but too big for something like twitter.  Most of these ramblings are going to be full of code snippets and that's about it.

    In order to accomplish this I created this kind of janky blog system in AngularJS.  You can see the source of the controller <a href="https://github.com/0x4445565A/0x4445565A.github.io/blob/master/js/blogController.js">here on github</a>.  The reason for having a complete database/dynamic language independent system was pretty simple.  I use GitHub pages and can only have static files, I am aware that GitHub Pages has a blog system, but personally to keep with the site I decided to implement this in AngularJS.

    The idea is pretty simple.  First I grab the post list which is a json file from <a href="./posts/list.json" target="_blank">/posts/list.json</a>.  I then loop through it to create the links of each article using ngRouter (As seen <a href="https://github.com/0x4445565A/0x4445565A.github.io/blob/master/index.html#L54" target="_blank">here</a>).  Once I have the links I use the list.json file to tell me what the body text file is and then I load it into the template.  It's all pretty simple and could be prettier or better written, but this was done in the span of a short night.

    By the very fact that you are reading this I can only say that I think things went over fairly well and that this experiment was a success!  I hope to make more interesting experiments in the future!  Some items on my list include screwing around with my Golang GuI boiler plate I wrote (Check it out <a href="https://github.com/0x4445565A/goGui" target="_blank">here</a>) as well as working with the kbpgp.js library from Keybase.io some more.
